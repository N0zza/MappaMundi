# If you are adding a non-rectangular flag to MM, make sure to set its canvas such that it forms a 2x3 (or 52x82 if you're so inclined) canvas just containing the flag. Then fill the background with rgb(22211E) / rgb(34, 33, 30) / HSV(45Â°, 11%, 13%) and flatten the image. Then you can add it as normal. This way, we can simulate transparency in-game without the edges getting fucked up if we went with a flag with actual transparencies.
