 mm.1.t:0 "Yeet the Princely States ?"
 mm.1.d:0 "Listen, I get it. The princely states are a pain in the ass to map with. This event will probably take roughly 10 minutes to finish, but if you want the princely states gone, then wait ten minutes. This event could also improve your game performance if you have a piece of shit computer."
