#Character limit: 2100 characters barely fits on my screen, and mine is pretty small. Avoid going over 2100 characters at all costs, especially if it doesn't fit on your screen. Avoid disclosing unecessary information.
#Organization: Make sure the first paragraph is the basics of who they are, and the alt-hist paragraph presenting alt-hist oppurtunities.
#Testing: At the end of every description (except for generic/unclaimed ones) there will be a note saying if it is confirmed to have fit the screen, testing needed, or it does not fit the screen. As of now, only I will be doing this. If you want to do it as well, DM me so I know what kind of computer you have.
#BEFORE EDITING: IF YOU SEEK TO MAKE A LEADER DESCRIPTION, SPEAK TO EGGO. If you're not planning to push this to Github, don't do that, and you don't need to listen to the second note.

POLITICS_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was a prominent French communist during the Interwar period and was a leader of the French Communist Party. Born in 1900 in Noyelles-Godault, Picardy, he joined the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO), but joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1920 when it split off. He quickly rose through the ranks of the PCF, becoming leader of the party in 1930, which he would be until his death.\n\nIn 1934, Thorez helped establish the Popular Front in France, a coalition that won the 1936 Election, putting the PCF in government until 1938, when the Front collapsed over conflicted opinions with the Munich agreement. During WWII, he would be in Moscow. In France, Jacques Duclos, Thorez's right-hand man, encouraged members to fight the German occupation, a move that would popularize the party after the war.\n\nIn November 1944, Thorez would return after his 4-year exile in Moscow. In the years between WWII and the Cold War, the PCF would be a popular party in France, mainly due to its role in the French Resistance. In the 1945 Election, a reformed Popular Front won, making Thorez Vice Premier. However, this government would again collapse in 1947 due to rising pressure from the Americans to kick out the communists from government, which happened, causing the May Crisis. He retained his leadership until he died in 1964 at the age of 64, on a cruise in the Black Sea.\n\nBut what if this happened differently? If the communists managed to seize power after WWII, and the May Crises of '47 never affected France? Or things could've proceeded differently in the '30s, and Thorez could have absolute control of France. The choice is yours." #Description fits screen
POLITICS_PIVERT_DESC:0 "Marceau Pivert was a French communist during the Interwar Period and into the Cold War. Born 1895 in Montmachoux, Paris, he was a soldier during WWI, which made him a staunch pacifist. After WWI, he became a teacher until 1939.\n\nHe joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1924 and was very radical compared to other members. In the 1930s, he began organizing the most radical members of the party into the 'Revolutionary Left' faction. The faction would soon come to be at odds with the SFIO, especially after the SFIO became part of the French Government in 1936 and Léon Blum became Prime Minister. The divides became so deep that Pivert and his faction left the SFIO and established their party, the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP).\n\nIn 1940, after the Fall of France, Phillipe Pétain banned and dissolved the PSOP, causing Pivert to flee to Mexico. After the war, most of the party, including himself, rejoined the SFIO, while some joined the French Communist Party (PCF), which had grown significantly from the war. Despite making amends with the SFIO, he disagreed with them frequently, most notably his stance on the Algerian War, where he supported Algerian independence, going against the vast majority of the party. He died in 1958 at the age of 62.\n\nUltimately, Marceau Pivert never had much of an impact on French politics. What if that was different? What if Marceau Pivert and the PSOP became popular? Maybe worked with the PCF, or maybe even merged with it, seizing power in France? The choice is yours."  #Description fits screen
POLITICS_BLUM_DESC:0 "Léon Blum was a prominent French Socialist during the Interwar Period and the beginning of the Cold War. Born in 1872 in Paris to a middle-class Jewish family, Blum was uninterested in politics as a child. However, the Dreyfus Affair in 1894 exposed systemic racism against Jews in French society, sparking a nationwide controversy.\n\nIn 1914, Jean Jaurès, a mentor and idol for Blum, was assassinated. Blum became involved in the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO) SFIO and became chair of the party's executive committee in 1919. In 1920, the French Communist Party (PCF) split from the SFIO due to disagreements on the Russian Revolution. In 1935, the SFIO, PCF, and other parties formed the Popular Front Coalition, and in 1936, they managed to form a government, making Blum Prime Minister. Despite the early success of the government, issues soon arose, and the coalition was volatile, leading Blum to resign in 1937. He returned to the position briefly in 1938, but the Popular Front quickly collapsed due to the Munich Agreement.\n\nAfter the German invasion of France, Blum did not attempt to free, despite severe risks, with him being both a socialist and Jew. The fear was confirmed, as he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he survived. After the war, Blum returned to politics and was Prime Minister again during a brief interim government. He died in 1950.\n\nBlum played a role in French politics during the 1930s but fell short due to instability in his government. What if he steered his party through those times? What if the Popular Front ruled France for most of the Interwar period? The choice is yours." #Description fits screen
POLITICS_JEANIII_DESC:0 "Jean Pierre Clément Marie d'Orléans de Chartres and the Duke of Guise, born in 1874, was the Orleanist claimant to the French throne. As a young adult, Jean settled in his estate, Nouvion-en-Thiérache. However, in 1909, wanting to help France expand overseas, the family moved to Larache, Morocco. However, in 1912, when France and Spain partitioned Morocco, Larache went to the Spanish, displeasing Jean greatly.\n\nWhen WWI broke out, Jean offered to serve. The French declined, not wanting nobles to partake in military service. However, the French allowed him to participate in a mission to Bulgaria in 1915, attempting to convince King Ferdinand I, his uncle, to join the Entente. The mission failed, as Bulgaria would join the Triple Alliance.\n\nAfter the war, Jean would return to Larache. In 1900, he was only a cadet in the family, very far from inheriting the throne.  However, he would become the Orleanist claimant in 1926. Due to the Exile Law of 1886, heads of the Orléans, Bonaparte, and Bourbon families weren't allowed to live in French territory. Therefore, he had to move to Belgium. After Germany invaded Belgium, he fled back to Larache, where he died a few months later at the age of 65.\n\nWhile Jean never managed to seize the French throne, what if he did? The French Action Party (AF), a reactionary Orleanist party, planned a coup d'etat to restore the monarchy, although the plan never came to fruition. However, if it did, the Orleanists would secure the French throne, and millions of things would become possible. The choice is yours." #Description fits screen
POLITICS_DALADIER_DESC:0 "Édouard Daladier was a French politician during the interwar period and was Prime Minister of France. He was born in 1884 in Carpentras, a small town in Provence.\n\nHe became Mayor of Carpentras in 1912. He ran to join the Chamber of Deputies but lost to the Radical-Socialist Party (PRRS). In WWI, he was a soldier. After the war, he returned to politics, entered the Chamber of Deputies, and joined the PRRS. Daladier served in several governmental positions during the Interwar period. In 1933, he became Prime Minister, but his government collapsed nine months later. However, in the wake of a major corruption scandal in the French government, Daladier was able to take power, although the government fell in a week because of riots that brought down his government. In 1935, he formed a coalition with the French Communist Party (PCF) and the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO), which would win the 1936 Election.\n\nHowever, the government would collapse due to disagreements on the Munich Agreement. Contradicting the SFIO and PCF, the PRRS went through with the agreement and took absolute control of the government, which made Daladier Prime Minister. Daladier resigned in March of 1940 due to the Winter War. The Nazis imprisoned him until 1945. He returned to politics briefly in the Chamber of Deputies and became Mayor of Avignon in 1953. After that, he retired from politics and died in 1970 at 86.\n\nWhile Daladier ultimately went through with the Munich Agreement, that doesn't mean he liked it; he only went through with it because Chamberlain did. What if someone else was in power instead of Chamberlain? Could an early WWII happen? The choice is yours." #Doesn't fit, needs to be very slightly shortened
POLITICS_LEBRUN_DESC:0 "Albert Lebrun was a French politician and President during the early 1900s and the Interwar Period. He was born in 1871 in Mercy-le-Haut, a small village in the Meurthe-et-Moselle area. He'd become a mining engineer, though he would enter politics in 1900, joining the Chamber of Deputies. In the 1910s, he'd have many roles in the French government.\n\nAfter the war, he joined the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD) and was elected to the French Senate, being its Vice President from 1925-1929 and President of the Senate from 1931-1932. In the aftermath of the assassination of President Paul Doumer in 1932, Lebrun would be elected President of France. He was re-elected in 1939, although it would not last long; as France collapsed in 1940, Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending Philippe Pétain as his replacement, which Lebrun would do. After the Chamber of Deputies allowed Pétain to rewrite the Constitution and sign an armistice with Germany, Pétain ousted Lebrun after a brief power struggle.\n\nHe fled to Vizille, a small town in southeastern France, where he remained under the radar until he was captured by the Wehrmacht in 1943. He'd be held in Castle Itter until he was allowed to leave due to sickness, but he'd remain under heavy surveillance. Lebrun retired from politics after the war and died of pneumonia after a protracted illness in 1950.\n\nLebrun played his role in France. He was a popular President, working across the aisle, which could've made him a longtime President if Germany didn't invade them. What if this happened? What if, for whatever reason, Germany didn't invade France? Lebrun would've peacefully ruled France as a popular President for many years. The choice is yours." #Doesn't fit, needs to be very slightly shortened
